# k0s-singleNode
I create this repo to track my learning process on setup a k8s using the smallest k8s distro which is k0s, not easy to setup but I will track the process here

I will use k0sctl as a commandline tool to provision the single node cluster

start a very basic/general config file 
` k0sctl init > k0sctl.yaml `
